# CS541_Image_Captioning_With_RL

### Summary
We propose a method for using Reinforcement Learning in conjunction with Deep Neural Networks to generate captions for images. We aim to implement a the system from scratch and potentially improve it through the optimization of DNN architecture's used.

### Existing Work
Zhou Ren et al. introduces a framework for a policy and value network architecture in "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Image Captioning with Embedding Reward" (2017) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1704.03899.  While this paper describes the concepts, there are unofficial implementations of deep reinforcement learning for image captioning, including https://github.com/Pranshu258/Deep_Image_Captioning/tree/master.  This unofficial implementation is contained within the Deep_Image_Captioning folder with its original state of correctness unknown.  New modifications may be made using this existing code to validate correctness and fix any errors, or new implementations may be made investigating Transformers.
